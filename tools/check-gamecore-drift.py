"""Checks that config-tool and ppuc-pinmame agree on the GameCore schema.

The `emGame:`, `tilt:` and `ballSave:` blocks are described in two places that
cannot see each other:

  * the exporter, config-tool/.../GamesController.php, which writes them
  * the parser, ppuc/src/game/GameConfigYaml.cpp, which reads them

A key added to one and not the other fails silently: the exporter writes
something nobody reads, or an operator sets a value in the UI that never
reaches the machine. This is the same hazard check-schema-drift.py covers for
the hardware schema, for the schema that came after it.

This lives in `ppuc` rather than in `libppuc` on purpose. libppuc sits *below*
ppuc in the stack and knows nothing about either side of this schema: the parser
is ppuc's own source, and the exporter belongs to config-tool. A libppuc CI job
that cloned both to compare them would invert the dependency and, worse, would
be red for the whole of any coordinated change.

Run it from a directory holding the ppuc checkout, with config-tool beside it:

    python3 ppuc/tools/check-gamecore-drift.py [--strict]

or from inside a ppuc checkout, pointing at config-tool:

    python3 tools/check-gamecore-drift.py --config-tool ../config-tool

Without --strict it reports and exits 0. That is the right default for CI here,
because the exporter lives in another repository whose main branch moves
independently: a ppuc pull request that adds a parser key is legitimately ahead
of config-tool until that side merges, and a job that went red for it would be
red through every coordinated change and ignored by the time it mattered. Use
--strict locally, and when closing out a change that touches both sides.
